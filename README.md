Initially built to aid a research project, SwitchWatch makes it easy to record and export state transitions of items under observation over time. 

Also, a good reason to play around with SwiftUI for the first time.

## App Features

- [x] Input Group Name, Trial Number, and Trial Day for an observation session
- [x] Configure multiple items to observe simultaneously
- [x] After beginning an observation, toggle an item to record a transition and swap that item's active timer
- [x] Export data
- [x] Automatically end a observation session after a pre-set amount of time

## Potential Future Features
- [ ] Ability to save/edit previous observation sessions
- [ ] Prettier UI


## Example Data Export

After completing an observation session, tap "share" to export two files.

### raw_transition_times.csv

As the name suggests, this file contains all the raw data recorded from every tap of every toggle throughout the session. Importing into excel/sheets/numbers looks something like:

### stats.csv

This file provides the rolled-up stats for each item during the observation session:
